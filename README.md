# react-refactor1

Hey there. I'm refactoring a company's website from a multi-page, but standard, website to a single-page, React website. This is the repo for the project. Estimated time to market is another 1 -2 weeks.

Feel free to check out the code as it is written here.

A fair warning: as the project is NOT complete, things may not display properly.

Also note: the original page is in English. I am also translating the site into another language. There are still English bits mixed in because I am laying out the pages with the original text before translating.
