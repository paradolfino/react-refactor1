# react-refactor1

Hey there. I'm refactoring a company's website from a multi-page, but standard, website to a single-page, React website. This is the repo for the project. Project is officially finished, but improvements are always being made.

Feel free to check out the code as it is written here.

Warning: have not done vendor prefixes for IE or Edge in regard to CSS Grid. App will not display properly on those browsers. This is an issue that will be fixed soon, however, either by me adding support or Microsoft doing so :).
